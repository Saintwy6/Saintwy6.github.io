In this assignment, I got to analyze real-world data. The central
question posed by the project is: Assessing a company\'s financial
health through sentiment analysis of limited data. To address the main
idea clear, the project was structured into three phases:

1.  **Preparation**: Downloading the 10-K filings from the internet.
2.  **Analysis**: Using loop functions to extract and analyze sentiment
    from the cleaned 10-K text, identifying information of value
    relevance.
3.  **Comparison**: Conducting a cross-sectional study to correlate the
    extracted sentiment variables with stock returns.

In this assignment, I learnt about how companies perceive their own
performance and how that correlates with the market's perception of
them.

This is the final sample I got after adding 13 varibles to the original
list of all S&P500 companies.

To build the return value, I took multiple steps to get there. Firstly,
I loaded the crsp_2022_only.zip to get all the stock returns in 2022.
This is a compressed dataframe, letting it work, I downloaded it as a
zip file and read it as a csv file. Here is the code I used for these
steps:

    url = 'https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/data/blob/main/Stock%20Returns%20(CRSP)/crsp_2022_only.zip?raw=true'

    with urlopen(url) as request:
        data = BytesIO(request.read())

    with ZipFile(data) as archive:
        with archive.open(archive.namelist()[0]) as stata:
            crsp = pd.read_stata(stata)

After having all the returns value, I still needed the exact 10-k date
to sort the returns value. To find the date,I needed the information for
each stock to track the 10-k release information on the sec.gov page.
The most informative source was the 10-k per se. Therefore, I downloaded
all 503 10-k files. Here is the code for downloading 10-k:

    sp500_file = 'inputs/sp500_2022.csv'

    if not os.path.exists(sp500_file):
        url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_S%26P_500_companies&oldid=1130173030'
        pd.read_html(url)[0].to_csv(sp500_file,index=False)

    sp500 = pd.read_csv('inputs/sp500_2022.csv') 

    ciks = sp500['CIK'].to_list()[:503]

    if not os.path.exists('10k_files/10k_files.zip'):
        
        for cik in tqdm(ciks): # tqdm() status bar 
             
            firm_folder = f'10k_files/sec-edgar-filings/{str(cik).zfill(10)}/'  # str(cik).zfill(10)   means that CIK 1234 becomes 0000001234

            # if I haven't downloaded any HTML for this firm (len=0 files on this pattern), do so
            if len(glob.glob(firm_folder + '/10-K/*/*.html')) == 0:
                
                dl.get("10-K", cik, 
                       limit=1,                 
                       after="2022-01-01",       
                       before="2022-12-31",      
                       download_details =True    
                ) 
        
           
            for txt_f in glob.glob(firm_folder + '/10-K/*/*.txt'):
                os.remove(txt_f)

I downloaded the list of all S&P500 companies first to get each
company\'s CIK. Then I created a list of CIKs from the DataFrame,
limited to the first 503 entries which is all the rows it included.
Moving on, for each CIK in the list, I constructed a directory path
where the 10-K filings should be stored. Also, I extended the CIK to 10
digits in the path for the better usage in the following steps. After I
successfully downloaded everything, I did a simple cleanup by removing
all the txt files since they don\'t make much sense in this homework.
With the data been settled, I took a check to see if there is any
omission. Here\'s the code I used for the data verification:

    files = glob.glob('10k_files/sec-edgar-filings/*/10-K/*/*.html')
    f'We have {len(files)} HTML files for {len(ciks)} firms'

The results I got clearly showing there are only 498 files for 503
firms. After consideration and research, I fathomed the causation of the
lost data. Two companies didn\'t release there 10-k at all, which was
proved correct in the following steps since I got a whole row of NaN for
the sentiment score. Other reason that led to the omission might be that
the CIK list extracted from the sp500_2022.csv contain inaccuracies,
such as outdated CIKs or entries that do not correspond to companies
required to file 10-K reports within your specified timeframe, or it
might be the format of the 10-k somehow became erroneous. Next, I
compressed it into zip file to save more spaces, and here\'s the code
for that:

    done_with_downloads = True 

    if os.path.exists('10k_files/sec-edgar-filings') and \
        not os.path.exists('10k_files/10k_files.zip') and \
        done_with_downloads:
        
        # zip the folder (15GB --> 3GB)
        shutil.make_archive('10k_files', 'zip', '10k_files')
        
        # delete the folder 
        shutil.rmtree('10k_files/sec-edgar-filings')
        
        # put the zip file in the `10k_files` folder
        shutil.move('10k_files.zip', '10k_files/')

Then, I built a loop to get the file path of all firms, which contain
the information(extended CIK and accession number) I needed for getting
10-k dates. And here\'s the code:

    with ZipFile('10k_files/10k_files.zip', 'r') as zipfolder:
        file_list = zipfolder.namelist()
        sp500 = pd.read_csv('inputs/sp500_2022.csv')
        session = HTMLSession()

        for index, row in sp500[:503].iterrows():
            firm = row['CIK']
            firm_folder = f"sec-edgar-filings/{str(firm).zfill(10)}/10-K/*/*.html"
            possible_files = fnmatch.filter(file_list, firm_folder)
            if len(possible_files) == 0:
                continue

            fpath = possible_files[0]  

With the information I needed, I accessed the secgov database:

    match = re.search(r'sec-edgar-filings/([^/]+)/10-K/([^/]+)', fpath)
            if match:
                cik = match.group(1)
                accession_number = match.group(2)

        
                url = f'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{cik}/{accession_number}-index.html'
                response = session.get(url)

Note that I already got the data in the url web page, the problem i was
facing at this point is how to extract the data from the web page:

     session = HTMLSession()
                response = session.get(url)
                date = response.html.find('.info', first=True).text

With the help of the CSS selector, I obtained the data of date. Then, I
tried to match the date with the value of returns in the crsp dataframe:

     filtered_df = crsp[(crsp['date'] == date)]
                return_value = filtered_df['ret'].iloc[0] if not filtered_df.empty else 'No match found'

Getting all the information I needed, I merged the data into the
original S&P500 dataframe for better comparison:

    stuff= date
                sp500.at[index,'date_t']=stuff
                stuff= return_value
                sp500.at[index,'return']=stuff

For the sentiment variables, I first cleaned up the 10-k file by
removing all the white space and punction to get the document length:

    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, features='lxml-xml')

            for div in soup.find_all("div", {'style': 'display:none'}):
                div.decompose()

            document = soup.text.lower()
            document = re.sub(r'\W', ' ', document)
            document = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', document)
            doc_length = len(document.split())

Then, by the means of Near_Regex, I built four word list with all the
sentiment measurement I needed. Note that, I tried to add the words as
single strings manually, but the Near_regex is only available up to 4

                sp500.at[index,'LM_negative_sentiment']=stuff

For the contextual part, I built three word list based on different
themes:

                stuff = ['emission', 'recycling', 'conservation', 'regulation','sustainability','efficiency']
                first_contextual_regx = "("+ "|".join(stuff) +")"
            
            
                stuff = ['research', 'development', 'technology', 'innovate','patent','prototype']
                second_contextual_regx = "("+ "|".join(stuff) +")"
            
            
                stuff = ['market', 'expand', 'global', 'presence','international','distribution']
                third_contextual_regx = "("+ "|".join(stuff) +")"

Combined the new three lists with the ML words (consists of two lists)
together, thus created six new variables:

                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ ML_negative_regx ,first_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_negative_first_context_sentiment']=stuff
            
                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ ML_negative_regx ,second_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_negative_second_context_sentiment']=stuff
           
                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ ML_negative_regx ,third_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_negative_third_context_sentiment']=stuff
            
                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ LM_positive_regx ,first_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_positive_first_context_sentiment']=stuff
            
                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ LM_positive_regx ,second_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_positive_second_context_sentiment']=stuff
            
                stuff= len(re.findall(NEAR_regex( [ LM_positive_regx ,third_contextual_regx] ),document)) / doc_length
                sp500.at[index,'ML_positive_third_context_sentiment']=stuff

The three context I chose for the contextual sentiment are:
Sustainability and Environmental Practices, Innovation and Technological
Development, Market Expansion and Global Presence. I regarded these
context as neutral and common in the world of business. And that can
help me to get a pile of unbiased sentiment scores of the text in a 10-K
around discussions of a particular topic. For the final sample, I
determined to remove the NaN before the download. Understanding that as
long as there\'s one empty cell, the whole row must be meaningless, I
detected and deleted those rows by finding empty ML_positive_sentiment:

    sp500 = sp500.dropna(subset=['ML_positive_sentiment'])
    sp500 = sp500.reset_index(drop=True)

    sp500.to_csv('output/analysis_sample.csv')

Above all, I believe the final sample is accurate and informative at
this point.

Now, I\'m going to measure the contextual sentiment. Since the three
context I chose are all neutral, I expect the sentiment score after
combining two word list together still align to the original
ML_sentiment_score. Before building the plot to check the alignment, I
first browsed the data in my disk to check the variations.Turned out,
all data are different which is good. Moving on, next step I checked if
the certain industry\'s result has met my expection. Take industries
sector as an example: I\'m expecting this most companies in this sector
tried to fullfill their responsibilty for the enviroment and
sustainability, so I checked the ML_positive_first_context_sentiment
column. In the Excel sheet, I filtered the Industry sector, and only
keep those two columns. The result came out is that most of the
sentiment score after combination decreased, but to some extend it
showed the pattern(inverse relationship), even though it was opposite to
my expection. Overall, the data I got is not suspicious.

**1. Compare / contrast the relationship between the returns variable
and the two "LM Sentiment" variables (positive and negative) with the
relationship between the returns variable and the two "ML Sentiment"
variables (positive and negative). Focus on the patterns of the signs of
the relationships and the magnitudes.**

The chart reveals that the two measures of sentiment, "LM" and "ML",
both have correlations in both negative and positive directions with the
returns, though they differ in magnitudes. The "ML positive sentiment"
and the "ML negative sentiment" having a more pronounced negative
correlation than the Â "LM" sentiment measures, indicates that the
sentiment scores from model \"ML\" might be more inversely related to
Returns. The \"LM positive sentiment\" is slightly positively correlated
while \"LM negative sentiment" shows a larger positive correlation,
suggesting for the \"LM\" measure a stronger connection between return
and Negative sentiments than Positive sentiments.

**2. If your comparison/contrast conflicts with Table 3 of the Garcia,
Hu, and Rohrer paper (ML_JFE.pdf, in the repo), discuss and brainstorm
possible reasons why you think the results may differ. If your patterns
agree, discuss why you think they bothered to include so many more firms
and years and additional controls in their study? (It was more work than
we did on this midterm, so why do it to get to the same point?)**

Data Selection: The data for the scatter plot might have come from a
specific subset, such as one industry or year. Table 3 might then have
included different, broader data entirely.

-   Sentiment Analysis Technique: There are multiple ways to analyze
    sentiment. For instance, "ML" likely used machine learning
    techniques that process natural language differently than the "LM"
    dictionary approach.

-   Financial Reporting Complexity: Financial reports can be complex and
    open to interpretation. Different sentiment analysis models might
    capture different aspects of this complexity.

-   Market Reaction Timing: The market's reaction to sentiment expressed
    in company reports could change over time. This is why there may be
    a difference in the period when returns are measured for the scatter
    plot, compared with the larger study.

-   Scope of Sentiment: Overall sentiment versus sentiment in specific
    report sections---like management discussion and analysis (MD&A)---
    could vary between the scatter plot and Table 3

-   Econometric Model Specifications: Different model specifications
    like fixed effects or control variables can affect results.

-   Noise in the Data: Financial data contains noise by nature. Small
    changes to how sentiment is measured or returns are calculated can
    lead to different results.

-   Contextual Factors: Broader economic or industry-specific conditions
    not accounted for uniformly across analyses could explain variances
    in observed relationships.

**3. Discuss your 3 "contextual" sentiment measures. Do they have a
relationship with returns that looks "different enough" from zero to
investigate further? If so, make an economic argument for why sentiment
in that context can be value relevant.**

If any of these contextual sentiments prove to be a solid correlation
with returns, it would indicate something of importance about the future
success of a company:

-   Sustainability and environmental practices: If there is an electric
    link between sentiment in this area and return. It could mean that
    investors value companies that are seen as environmentally
    responsible. These practices have the potential to reduce risk, save
    cost and improve a company\'s image. All things that can catch an
    investors eye.

-   Innovation and technological development: A strong sentiment in this
    context could point to a company\'s ability to stay ahead of the
    curve and introduce new products or services. This kind of
    innovative edge can be a good sign of future profits and growth,
    drawing in investors who are looking for the next big thing.

-   Market Expansion and global presence: Positive sentiment here might
    be tied to a company's potential to tap into new markets or scale
    operations globally. Expansion has its perks, it opens up new doors
    (revenue streams) and diversifies risk which could translate into
    better stock performance.

If any of these contextual sentiments show substantial correlation, it
would be worth investigating further. They could provide investors with
deeper insights into a company\'s strategic positioning and long-term
prospects beyond what\'s captured by traditional financial metrics.

**4. Is there a difference in the sign and magnitude? Speculate on why
or why not.**
:::

::: {#ed7a75dc-936b-4a8a-aa08-2ba3dd428eb2 .cell .markdown}
The correlations between different sentiment measures and returns differ
not just in sign but also in magnitude. This may be because the
algorithms or methodologies used to analyze \"ML\" and \"LM\" sentiments
capture sentiment from different angles. For instance, they might focus
on immediate emotions or long-term moods respectively. On the other
hand, that difference in magnitude might hint at specific sentiment
measures being more sensitive to factors that directly affect stock
returns such as product launches, regulatory changes, or earnings
announcements. These varied correlations help shed light into what kind
of sentiments are given weight by the market and how they're reflected
in stock prices.
